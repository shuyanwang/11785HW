"""
Follow the instructions provided in the writeup to completely
implement the class specifications for a basic MLP, optimizer, .
You will be able to test each section individually by submitting
to autolab after implementing what is required for that section
-- do not worry if some methods required are not implemented yet.

Notes:

The __call__ method is a special reserved method in
python that defines the behaviour of an object when it is
used as a function. For example, take the Linear activation
function whose implementation has been provided.

# >>> activation = Identity()
# >>> activation(3)
# 3
# >>> activation.forward(3)
# 3
