# Homework Repository for 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning, Spring 2021.
This repo contains four homework projects for the [deep learning course](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S21/index.html) at CMU.
For each homework assignment, part 1 contributes to a personalized PyTorch-like deep learning library, whereas part 2 solves an actual machine learning task.

- P1: Activations, BN, Linear layer, Loss.
- P2: Frame Level Classification of Speech with MLP.
- Bonus: Adam optimizer, Dropout.

## HW2: An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- P1: Scanning MLP, CNN.
- P2: Face Classification & Verification with CNN.
- Bonus: Mean and Max Pooling.

## HW3: Recurrent Neural Networks and Connectionist Temporal Classification
